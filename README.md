## My Approach to Clean Code:

I made a conscious effort to follow clean code principles to ensure the code is easy to read, maintain, and extend. I believe that well-written code should speak for itself, so I focused on making it clear and intuitive, minimizing the need for comments. I spent time ensuring that variables and functions have names that clearly describe their purpose, which helps anyone reading the code understand what’s happening right away.

I also organized the code into logical components, such as services, controllers, and models, to keep everything focused on a single responsibility. Error handling is implemented to manage invalid inputs and unexpected situations, ensuring a smooth user experience. Lastly, the app is built with modular, reusable code, so that future changes or additions can be easily handled without affecting the overall structure.
